# Twitter-api-project-
This is a simple twitter API project that is written in python and uses the tweeypy library to collect tweets and compare their popularity per some specific programming language kewords and hashtages(#)

Requirements to execute the program:

Pandas
openpyxl
Tweepy
Python 3.9
Github for Visual Studio Code

Download python 3.9 from microsoft store if using Windows 10 or 11 and reboot computer.
Open Visual Studio Code or any other ide, in visual studio code go to terminal --> new terminal --> see bottom window says terminal and enter "pip install pandas". After installing pandas type "pip install tweepy" and last to export and view it in excel "pip install openpyxl". Reboot IDE or computer if it does not run. 


After downloading as a .zip file this project extract it anywhere you wish and  on visual studio code do the following:
    click "File"
    click under "File", "Open Folder..."
    select the folder that contains this program 
    Download github pull request and  github repositories from the visual studio code extensions to be able to commit new changes. 
    To commit simply go to source control the third icon from the top left on your screen and click on "Publish to Github" however you must first download git             https://git-scm.com/download/win or a git gui such as github desktop. 
    If you have troubles with visual studio code to commit new changes, download https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32 github desktop and     click on "File" --> "Clone Repository" --> "URL" and follow the onscreen instructions by the program. 

1. Download the folder 
2. Open favourite ide (Visual studio code recommended)
3. Open twitter_data_search.py  run without debugging works with debug too but slower
4. Go to each .xlsx file  and open it via Microsoft Excel or any other spreadsheet program that is compatible with this file format to see all tweets with containing each file keyword. It shows the latest 100 tweets, however each time the user runs it it will show the previous 100 so in every run 100 are added in each programming language file in excel .
